Graywolf is a modern APRS station with a software modem, digipeater, iGate, and web UI. It bundles everything you need to put an APRS station on the air — from raw audio demodulation to APRS-IS gating — and makes it easy with a browser-based configuration interface.

Written by Chris Snell, [NW5W](https://nw5w.com). 

The modem is written in Rust and includes a port of the AFSK demodulator from [Dire Wolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf) by WB2OSZ.  The decision-feedback AGC and hard-limiter correlator techniques are credited to Ion Todirel (W7ION), from his [libmodem](https://github.com/iontodirel/libmodem).

The AX.25 decoding, APRS operatations (beacons, digipeater, and iGate), and the web API is handled by a service written in the Go programming language.

The web frontend was built in Svelte.

## Performance

Graywolf's AFSK demodulator beats Direwolf's best mode (`-P AD+`) on every track of the [WA8LMF TNC test CD](http://www.wa8lmf.net/TNCtest/), at about 5% of a Raspberry Pi 5.

| WA8LMF Track | Direwolf | Graywolf |
|---|---:|---:|
| 01 — 40-min traffic | 1020 | **1026** |
| 02 — DE-emphasized Mic-E | 1000 | 1000 |
| 03 — flat Mic-E (100 reps) | 100 | 100 |
| 04 — drive test | 107 | **108** |

Reproduce with `./bench.sh`.
