Graywolf is a modern APRS station with a software modem, digipeater, iGate, and web UI. It bundles everything you need to put an APRS station on the air — from raw audio demodulation to APRS-IS gating — and makes it easy with a browser-based configuration interface. 

[**Download the Latest Release**](https://github.com/chrissnell/graywolf/releases/latest) — prebuilt for Linux (Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora/RHEL), macOS, and Windows.

Written by Chris Snell, [NW5W](https://nw5w.com). 

The modem is written in Rust and includes a port of the AFSK demodulator from [Dire Wolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf) by WB2OSZ.  The decision-feedback AGC and hard-limiter correlator techniques are credited to Ion Todirel (W7ION), from his [libmodem](https://github.com/iontodirel/libmodem).

The AX.25 decoding, APRS operatations (beacons, digipeater, and iGate), and the web API is handled by a service written in the Go programming language.

The web frontend was built in Svelte.

## Performance

Graywolf's AFSK demodulator beats Direwolf's best mode (`-P AD+`) on every track of the [WA8LMF TNC test CD](http://www.wa8lmf.net/TNCtest/), at about 5% of a Raspberry Pi 5.

| WA8LMF Track | Direwolf | Graywolf |
|---|---:|---:|
| 01 — 40-min traffic | 1020 | **1026** |
| 02 — DE-emphasized Mic-E | 1000 | 1000 |
| 03 — flat Mic-E (100 reps) | 100 | 100 |
| 04 — drive test | 107 | **108** |

Reproduce with `./bench.sh`. 

## Features

</p>

- **Modern Web UI** - GW is managed via the browser, with a responsive interface that works well on desktops and smartphones. 

- **Software Modem** - High performance DSP written in Rust that's slightly more effective than Direwolf and much better than most hardware TNCs.  Efficeint: uses about 19% of a single CPU core on a Raspberry Pi 5.

- **Live Map** - Like having a private aprs.fi for your station.  Real-time APRS map with trails, digipeater paths, weather overlays, and beautiful animated NEXRAD weather radar, all rendered on our private vector basemap.  You can download maps for your state/province/country for offline use!

- **Messages** - SMS-style APRS messaging with delivery status and unread badges

  - Direct messages with auto-ACK and retry
  - Tactical callsigns (e.g. `GRAYWOLF`, `AMIGOS`) for group nets
  - RF-first delivery with APRS-IS fallback
  - Long messages up to 200 characters

- **Actions** - Trigger scripts remotely with specially-crafted APRS messages
  - Can trigger via shell script, Powershell script, or webhook
  - Can be secured with one-time passwords a la Google Authenticator or 1Password

- **AX.25 Terminal** - Built-in connected-mode terminal client in the web UI

  - Connect to BBSes, nodes, and other stations over AX.25
  - Macros and configurable presets for quick connects
  - Live channel monitor

- **Push-to-Talk** - Multiple PTT methods for any setup

  - Serial RTS/DTR (Digirig, USB-serial adapters)
  - CM108 USB HID GPIO (AIOC, homebrew sound card adapters)
  - Linux GPIO (Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone)
  - Hamlib rigctld (CAT control)
  - VOX (voice-operated keying, no PTT wiring required)
  - Digirig Lite Tone PTT (keys on a right-channel tone, no PTT wiring required)

- **Digipeater** - Full-featured APRS digipeater

  - WIDEn-N path handling
  - Preset-driven configuration (fill-in, wide-area, etc.)
  - Duplicate suppression
  - Per-path filtering

- **iGate** - Bidirectional APRS-IS gateway

  - RF → APRS-IS and APRS-IS → RF gating
  - Configurable filters
  - Packet origin tracking in logs

- **TNC Interfaces** - Speak the protocols other packet software expects

  - KISS TNC with native serial and network (TCP) support
  - AGWPE TCP interface

- **Beacons and GPS** - Position reporting made easy

  - Static and GPS-driven position beacons
  - Status and telemetry beacons
  - Configurable beacon intervals and paths

- **Observability**

  - [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics
  - Packet logging to SQLite database, with search ability
  - Live packet stream in the web UI

- **Simple installation** - single binary, SQLite config database

  - systemd service unit
  - Debian/Ubuntu (APT), Red Hat (RPM), and Arch (AUR) packages
  - Windows installer
  - macOS binaries
  - Runs on x86-64 and ARM (Raspberry Pi)

## Which download do I use?

Grab the build that matches your hardware from the [latest release](https://github.com/chrissnell/graywolf/releases/latest). On Linux, pick the `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu), `.rpm` (Fedora/RHEL), or `.tar.gz` (anything else) with the matching architecture suffix.

| Your hardware | Build to download |
|---|---|
| PC, server, or mini-PC (Intel/AMD 64-bit) | `x86_64` (`amd64`) |
| Raspberry Pi 3 / 4 / 5, Pi Zero 2 W, or any ARM board running a **64-bit** OS | `arm64` (`aarch64`) |
| 32-bit OS on a NEON-capable ARMv7 board — Pi 2 / 3 / 4, Rockchip RV1106, BeagleBone, most modern SBCs | `armv7l` |
| Oldest Pis — Pi 1, Pi Zero / Zero W (ARMv6) | `armv6l` |
| macOS, Apple Silicon (M1–M4) | macOS `arm64` |
| macOS, Intel | macOS `x86_64` |
| Windows | `Windows_x86_64` installer |

**Not sure?** On Linux, run `uname -m` — its output is exactly the suffix to look for: `x86_64`, `aarch64` (use the `arm64` build), `armv7l`, or `armv6l`.

**armv6l vs. armv7l:** both are 32-bit ARM hard-float. The `armv7l` build enables NEON, so the Rust modem's demodulator runs vectorized and noticeably faster — use it whenever your board is Cortex-A7 or newer. The `armv6l` build is the universal fallback that runs on every 32-bit Pi (including the ARMv6-only Pi 1 / Zero) but stays scalar; it will also run on ARMv7 boards, just slower. Don't use `armv7l` on an ARMv6-only Pi — it will fail with an illegal-instruction error.

Running a 64-bit OS on a Pi 3/4/5? Prefer the `arm64` build over either 32-bit one.
