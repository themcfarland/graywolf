# Invariants

Cross-cutting "if you change X, also touch Y" rules. Each entry: rule,
one-line *why*, source.

### 1. Root `Cargo.toml` is a workspace shim, sole member `graywolf-modem`

*Why:* Lets cross-rs's Docker mount see `proto/` and `VERSION` from the repo root; cargo output therefore lands at `/target/`, which Makefile, modem-path fallbacks, modembridge integration tests, and release CI all hard-code.

Source: [`../../Cargo.toml`](../../Cargo.toml) (comment is authoritative),
[`../../Makefile`](../../Makefile),
[`../../graywolf/pkg/app/modem.go`](../../graywolf/pkg/app/modem.go).

### 2. `proto/graywolf.proto` is the single Go<->Rust IPC contract

*Why:* Both sides regenerate from this file (wire format `[4 BE bytes length][IpcMessage]`), so any change requires regenerating both.

Source: [`../../proto/graywolf.proto`](../../proto/graywolf.proto). Go:
`make proto` -> `graywolf/pkg/ipcproto/graywolf.pb.go`. Rust:
[`../../graywolf-modem/build.rs`](../../graywolf-modem/build.rs) ->
`OUT_DIR/graywolf.rs`.

### 3. Version locks

*Why:* `make bump-*` rewrites every version-bearing file in lockstep, so hand edits drift and downstream packaging breaks.

Source: bump targets in [`../../Makefile`](../../Makefile)
(`VERSION`, `graywolf-modem/Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`,
`packaging/aur/PKGBUILD`, `packaging/aur/.SRCINFO`,
`docs/handbook/installation.html`).

### 4. Release notes precede the bump

*Why:* The bump targets `grep` `graywolf/pkg/releasenotes/notes.yaml` for the *new* version and refuse to run if the entry is missing.

Source: [`../../Makefile`](../../Makefile),
[`../../graywolf/pkg/releasenotes/notes.yaml`](../../graywolf/pkg/releasenotes/notes.yaml),
[`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md).

### 5. Release notes ship as-tagged (retag contract)

*Why:* When CI fails after tag-push and you delete-and-re-tag the same version, leave the note alone -- operators see whatever shipped at the final successful tag, and silent reword between retags is a trust hazard.

Source: [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) ("Retag contract").

### 6. Plain ASCII in release notes

*Why:* No emoji, em dashes, smart quotes, or non-ASCII punctuation -- keeps the operator-facing changelog portable since bump targets do not re-encode the YAML.

Source: [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md);
[`../../graywolf/pkg/releasenotes/notes.yaml`](../../graywolf/pkg/releasenotes/notes.yaml)
header.

### 7. PMTiles / offline-maps infra lives in `~/dev/graywolf-maps`, not here

*Why:* Tile generation, R2 sync, manifest publishing, and the origin Cloudflare Worker all live in the maps repo; graywolf is a *client* (`mapsauth`, `mapscache`, MapLibre rendering).

Source: absence of those modules in this tree;
`~/dev/graywolf-maps/.context/graywolf-client-integration.md`.

### 8. Audio I/O is on the Rust side

*Why:* CPAL runs in `graywolf-modem` and Go talks to the modem only via the IPC proto, keeping realtime DSP out of Go's GC and platform-specific audio in one place.

Source: [`../../graywolf-modem/src/audio/`](../../graywolf-modem/src/audio/);
no CPAL dep in `graywolf/pkg/`; control surface is the proto messages
`ConfigureAudio` / `StartAudio` / `StopAudio` / `EnumerateAudioDevices`.

### 9. PTT enumeration vs. driving split

*Why:* Go enumerates PTT hardware and Rust drives it, so both sides must agree on the identifier scheme passed via `ConfigurePtt.method` and `ConfigurePtt.device`.

Source: [`../../graywolf/pkg/pttdevice/`](../../graywolf/pkg/pttdevice/);
[`../../graywolf-modem/src/tx/`](../../graywolf-modem/src/tx/);
[`../../proto/graywolf.proto`](../../proto/graywolf.proto)
(`ConfigurePtt`).

### 10. Gitignored output dirs are not canonical

*Why:* `target/`, `bin/`, `dist/`, `rust-bin/`, `rust-artifacts/`, `graywolf/web/dist/`, `.worktrees/`, `.context/`, `*.db*` regenerate from sources and are gitignored, so never reference them as authoritative.

Source: [`../../.gitignore`](../../.gitignore);
[`build-pipelines.md`](build-pipelines.md).

### 11. Generated-bindings drift is enforced in CI

*Why:* `docs-check` and `api-client-check` regenerate to a tempdir and diff against committed copies, running inside `make go-test` and the pre-commit hook.

Source: [`../../Makefile`](../../Makefile),
[`../../.githooks/`](../../.githooks/), `make install-hooks`.

### 12. Web UI is embedded into the Go binary at compile time

*Why:* `go:embed all:dist` produces a self-contained binary, but the dir must exist at build time -- a placeholder `.keep` suffices until `npm run build` populates it.

Source: [`../../graywolf/web/embed.go`](../../graywolf/web/embed.go).

### 13. Modem readiness signal is on stdout, not the IPC channel

*Why:* The Go parent waits for `\n` (Unix) or `<port>\n` (Windows) on the modem's stdout before connecting, avoiding a connect-retry race against the bind.

Source: [`../../graywolf-modem/src/ipc/server.rs`](../../graywolf-modem/src/ipc/server.rs);
[`../../graywolf/pkg/modembridge/`](../../graywolf/pkg/modembridge/)
(`ipc_unix.go`, `ipc_windows.go`).

### 14. Version display string is shared across Go and Rust

*Why:* Both sides produce `v<Version>-<GitCommit>` and modembridge checks them at startup, so a mismatch immediately flags that the two halves of the build disagree.

Source:
[`../../graywolf/cmd/graywolf/main.go`](../../graywolf/cmd/graywolf/main.go),
[`../../graywolf/pkg/app/config.go`](../../graywolf/pkg/app/config.go),
[`../../graywolf-modem/build.rs`](../../graywolf-modem/build.rs).

### 15. Default IS->RF policy is deny

*Why:* The IS->RF rule engine evaluates rules in priority order and drops anything no rule matches, preventing accidental flooding of RF with arbitrary internet traffic.

Source: [`../../graywolf/pkg/igate/filters/filters.go`](../../graywolf/pkg/igate/filters/filters.go)
(package comment).

### 16. TX path is single-source-of-truth via `txgovernor`

*Why:* Every TX origin (KISS, AGW, beacons, digipeater, iGate IS->RF) funnels through one Governor for per-channel rate limits, dedup, and priority -- new sources must route through it, not around.

Source: [`../../graywolf/pkg/txgovernor/governor.go`](../../graywolf/pkg/txgovernor/governor.go)
(package comment).

### 17. RX fanout carries provenance via `ingress.Source` (in-process)

*Why:* Lets KISS broadcast suppress its own loopback without leaking a transport detail into the proto -- the provenance tag is in-process only, never on the wire.

Source: [`../../graywolf/pkg/app/ingress/source.go`](../../graywolf/pkg/app/ingress/source.go)
(package comment).

### 18. Generated artifacts that ship in commits

*Why:* CI's drift guards (see [invariant 11](invariants.md)) only work if regenerated copies are committed; bump targets stage them so each release tag includes them.
