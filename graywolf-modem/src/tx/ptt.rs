//! PTT (push-to-talk) drivers for the TX path.
//!
//! Drives the radio's PTT line via serial modem-control handshake lines
//! (RTS/DTR), or leaves it as a no-op for VOX-keyed rigs. CM108 (USB HID)
//! and Linux GPIO slots exist in [`PttMethod`] for later phases; building
//! one today returns a typed error rather than silently falling through
//! to `None`, so a misconfigured channel fails loudly instead of keying
//! nothing on the air.
//!
//! ## Shared fds
//!
//! A single serial port is opened at most once per device path. Two
//! channels that share a device (e.g. one driving RTS, the other DTR)
//! both receive handles to the *same* underlying port through
//! [`PortRegistry`]. Opening the same TTY twice from one process either
//! fights on modem-control ioctls or fails outright on `flock`, so
//! direwolf caches serial fds per device and we follow suit. See
//! `direwolf/src/ptt.c:894-906, 937`.
//!
//! ## Platform adapters
//!
//! The hardware-facing code lives in two sibling modules that each
//! expose a single struct implementing [`ModemControlLines`]:
//!
//! - [`ptt_unix`] — `nix::fcntl::open` with
//!   `O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NONBLOCK | O_CLOEXEC`, zero termios calls,
//!   `ioctl(TIOCMSET)` for modem control. Mirrors direwolf's Unix path
//!   (`direwolf/src/ptt.c:928-960`). Never calling `tcsetattr` is
//!   deliberate: on some USB-serial adapters a `tcsetattr` briefly
//!   bounces the RTS/DTR lines, which would key PTT the moment we open
//!   the port.
//!
//! - [`ptt_win`] — `CreateFileW` in shared mode (`FILE_SHARE_READ |
//!   FILE_SHARE_WRITE`) plus `EscapeCommFunction(SET/CLR RTS/DTR)`.
//!   Mirrors direwolf's Windows path (`direwolf/src/ptt.c:920-925`).
//!   Windows has no termios analog, so the "don't touch termios"
//!   concern from the Unix side does not apply. Shared-mode is what
//!   lets `rigctld` / `fldigi` open the same COM port alongside us.
//!
//! Neither adapter reads or writes the device — they only move modem
//! control lines — so baud rate, parity, and line discipline are all
//! irrelevant.
//!
//! ## Startup unkey
//!
//! [`PortRegistry::serial_driver`] calls `driver.unkey()` before
//! returning. This is a direwolf-parity safety step: on Linux the
//! kernel's TTY layer asserts DTR during `open()` regardless of what
//! userspace asks for, and the explicit `ioctl(TIOCMSET)` we issue
//! immediately after `open()` narrows the window to microseconds — too
//! short for a mechanical relay or optoisolator to respond. Without
//! this, a DTR-keyed rig would transmit continuously from
//! ConfigurePtt until the first beacon.
//!
//! ## macOS device-name gotcha
//!
//! On macOS the DigiRig (and every other USB-serial adapter) shows up
//! twice: `/dev/cu.usbserial-*` and `/dev/tty.usbserial-*`. The `tty.*`
//! variant blocks `open()` forever waiting for DCD assert even with
//! `O_NONBLOCK`. This is a macOS TTY-subsystem behaviour, not something
//! any userspace crate addresses. The PTT UI hint and the loopback
//! README document this; configure graywolf with the `cu.*` path.
//!
//! ## Internal abstraction
//!
//! [`SerialLinePtt`] is written against [`ModemControlLines`] — a tiny
//! two-method trait — so tests can verify fd-sharing semantics with an
//! in-memory fake instead of touching real hardware, and so the Unix
//! and Windows adapters can slot in behind `#[cfg]` without the
//! higher-level code caring.
