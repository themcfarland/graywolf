//! Dedicated TX worker thread.
//!
//! The IPC handler never blocks on audio drain — it builds samples, pushes
//! a [`TxJob`] onto the worker queue, and returns immediately. The worker
//! owns every [`AudioSink`] and every PTT driver, and processes one
//! transmission at a time, serializing TX across the whole modem.
//!
//! Serializing through a single worker (rather than one thread per channel
//! plus a per-device mutex) matches the common amateur deployment pattern
//! of one operator / one rig per band and is strictly simpler than
//! direwolf's model. Two channels using *different* output devices will
//! serialize instead of transmitting concurrently; if a future user ever
//! needs that, split this into one worker per output device.
//!
//! The worker owns its PTT driver table outright. `ConfigurePtt` on the
//! IPC thread builds the driver (opening any necessary serial port on
//! the IPC thread) and ships it here as a [`TxMessage::RegisterDriver`]
//! — the driver's `Box<dyn PttDriver>` is `Send`, and once it lives in
//! the worker's table only the worker thread ever touches it.
