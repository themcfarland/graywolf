//! Multi-configuration AFSK demodulator.
//!
//! Runs several [`AfskDemodulator`] instances over the same audio stream in
//! parallel (conceptually — processing is actually serialized per sample) and
//! emits a deduplicated stream of decoded frames.
//!
//! # Attribution
//!
//! Two of the building blocks the recommended ensemble relies on — the
//! decision-feedback AGC inside Profile A and the hard-limiter-before-
//! bandpass correlator used by the `A9HL` variant — are based on designs
//! published by Ion Todirel (W7ION) on the APRS Users Facebook group.
//! His reference implementation at <https://github.com/iontodirel/libmodem>
//! was the source of both techniques. The ensemble architecture that
//! combines them across Profile A / A-with-HL / Profile B is also his
//! "hydra" idea, adapted here to graywolf's existing profile ports.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! No single demodulator configuration is best across all radio conditions:
//!
//! - Profile A with a hard-limiter is the best single configuration on clean
//!   audio (about +4 packets on the WA8LMF Track 1 reference at Bell 202),
//!   but collapses on de-emphasized audio because the hard-limiter captures
//!   the stronger mark tone and erases the weaker space tone.
//! - Profile A without a hard-limiter is the best single configuration on
//!   de-emphasized audio but leaves a few packets on the table when audio
//!   is flat.
//! - Profile B (FM discriminator) catches a small residual set that the
//!   amplitude-comparison profile A never sees.
//!
//! Running three demodulators in parallel and unioning their outputs lands
//! within 0.3% of the best theoretical coverage our demodulator family can
//! achieve, regardless of channel condition.
//!
//! # Deduplication
//!
//! The same transmission will usually be decoded by two or three of the
//! demodulators, and within multi-slicer variants also by several slicers
//! in the same demod. We dedup by _(frame content, sample offset within a
//! configurable window)_ so that:
//!
//! - A rebroadcast of the same frame several seconds later counts as two
//!   events (two real transmissions).
//! - The same physical transmission decoded by two demods that happened to
//!   fire their closing-flag detection a few samples apart counts as one.
//!
//! The default window is 3 symbol times (110 samples at 44.1 kHz / 1200
//! baud), matching Direwolf's `multi_modem.c` PROCESS_AFTER_BITS. This is
//! wide enough to collapse the same transmission decoded by several
//! slicers within one symbol period, yet narrow enough that legitimate
//! fast rebroadcasts (digipeater hops, APRS-IS reinjection) count as
//! separate events — matching Direwolf's event-counting semantics exactly.
//!
//! # Typical use
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use graywolfmodem::demod_afsk_multi::{MultiAfskDemodulator, MultiConfig};
//! use graywolfmodem::types::AfskProfile;
//!
//! let mut demod = MultiAfskDemodulator::new(
//!     44100, 1200, 1200, 2200,
//!     0,
//!     &[
//!         MultiConfig { profile: AfskProfile::A, slicers: 9, hard_limit: false },
//!         MultiConfig { profile: AfskProfile::A, slicers: 9, hard_limit: true  },
//!         MultiConfig { profile: AfskProfile::B, slicers: 9, hard_limit: false },
//!     ],
//! );
//!
//! for sample in audio_samples() {
//!     demod.process_sample(sample);
//! }
//!
//! for frame in demod.take_frames() {
//!     // exactly one frame per real transmission event
//! }
//! # fn audio_samples() -> Vec<i32> { vec![] }
//! ```
